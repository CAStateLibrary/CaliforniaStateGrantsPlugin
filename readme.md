## Overview

The California Grants Portal, [grants.ca.gov](https://www.grants.ca.gov/), is managed and hosted by the California State Library. The [Grant Information Act of 2018](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2252) (Stats. 2018, Ch. 318) required the State Library to build one website by July 1, 2020, "that provides a centralized location ... to find state grant opportunities." State grantmaking agencies input and update their information into prescribed data fields to make all state grant opportunities searchable on [grants.ca.gov](https://www.grants.ca.gov/). The Grant Information Act requires state agencies to provide summaries of each of their grant or loan opportunities, including, among other items, information about how to apply and links that grantseekers can follow for more details. [AB132](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB132) expanded the Grants Portal mission, requiring state grantmakers to submit post award data for all grants closing on or after July 1, 2022. This site was built in collaboration with our vendor [10up](https://10up.com/).

The California State Grants Plugin is the official WordPress plugin allowing the state agencies to submit their grant information and post award information via the plugin and manage the grant data within their own WordPress site.
